- 👋 Hi, I’m Mary Sims 
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, writing, military history (especially Germany, England, Russia and Italy during the turn of the century - 20th century, that is). I am also an advocate of the Constitution. I strongly believe the 2nd protects the 1st. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CyberSecurity at HackerU. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, that's up in the air right now as I'm looking at coding an app. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Facebook is the best place or here. I can also be found on LinkedIn.
